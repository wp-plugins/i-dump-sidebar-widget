The i-Dump Sidebar Widget will show your pictures into your sidebar. You'll need the i-Dump plugin first.

== Description ==

The i-Dump Sidebar Widget will show your pictures into your sidebar. Of course you can setup your desired settings for the Widget. For this plugin you need the i-Dump plugin first, and the WP-Dump application, available in the AppStore on the iPhone also.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `i-dump-sidebar-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to 'Appearance' -> 'Widgets' into your WordPress Menu, and see the new 'i-Dump Sidebar Widget' widget.
4. Setup your desired settings, so how many pictures you want to show down into your sidebar and what will be the 'width' and 'height' for all pictures.
5. <strong>Caution</strong>: Install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/i-dump-iphone-to-wordpress-photo-uploader/">i-Dump plugin</a> (v1.1.4 and higher) for WordPress and download the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/wp-dump/id413231620?mt=8&ls=1">WP-Dump application</a> (v1.1) on your iPhone before you can run the i-Dump Sidebar Widget!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My widget is not working? =

That could be possible, because you will need to download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/i-dump-iphone-to-wordpress-photo-uploader/">i-Dump plugin</a> (v1.1.4 and higher) first before you can run this widget.

= What do I need to make the i-Dump Sidebar Widget work? =

You will need 2 things for sure, and 1 thing as option.
First of all you need an iPhone with the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/wp-dump/id413231620?mt=8&ls=1">WP-Dump application</a> on it (you can download that app in the AppStore).
Then you will need the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/i-dump-iphone-to-wordpress-photo-uploader/">i-Dump plugin</a> as well, because the i-Dump Sidebar Widget is an expanding feature of the i-Dump plugin.
Last but not least, it would be nice to have the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-fancybox/">Easy Fancybox plugin</a>. That will show down your pictures perfectly!

= When I click on a picture, it opens in the same window and looks bad? =

Correct, the default settings for showing a picture are bad looking. We have a great solution for that: Download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-fancybox/">Easy Fancybox plugin</a> for a great view when you clicked on a picture.

= I have another question? =
